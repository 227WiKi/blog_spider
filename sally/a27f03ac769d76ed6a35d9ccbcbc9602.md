First of all. Please take a look at this new character design for our second single “Shampoo no Nioi ga shita” 

(Obviously Fujima Sakura sleeping in a pile of Sakura is nothing more than aesthetics but let’s leave that aside for now) 

In the live event taking place on February 27th (Tuesday) there’s also going to be a section where three members are to narrate a given story. 

YES ONLY THREE! (Screaming) The three members are supposed to be chosen on the showroom stream by the audience next week starting from Tuesday February 6th 8pm Japan Time. 

It’s a voting based tournament where two members read the same story and at the end of the stream, the viewers vote for the better narrator.

The first pair is going to be me vs Hanakawa Mei from 8pm Japan Time. 

I wanted to explain the details yesterday at the end of the group stream to the international audience but I didn’t have enough time ;-; I’m sorry. I read all your comments though! 

It would mean the world to me if you guys can make time next week and stop by to come listen 🤗

I REALLY WANT TO NARRATE AT THE UPCOMING LIVE EVENT IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE >_<!! And every vote counts for each member so please stop by for everyone ❤️ 

Here’s the schedule for each member ❤️

2/6 (Tue)Sally Amaki + Hanakawa Mei

2/7 (Wed)Suzuhana Moe + Takeda Aina

2/8 (Thu) Hokaze Chiharu + Shirosawa Kanae
