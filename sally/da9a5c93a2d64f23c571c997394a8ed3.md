Please help me. 


I haven’t been outside to see the sun since December 31, 2017. ☀️


The only UV light I get is the light from my PC and phone. 


I also haven’t seen my friends in 4 days either. 


I’m held captive by my naps:



And here I am.... wondering why nobody hangs out with me anymore. 


Literally the only people that put up with me are my two best friends. 


...... or not. 



I can’t believe it’s already the 3rd today. What happened to the past few days? Where have I been? I literally don’t have any memory. Somebody Help??


School starts soon too and I haven’t done any of the reports I had to do.... MY LIFE IS A MESS AND IT’S ONLY DAY 3!


Goodnight (again.)
