GOOD EVENING!!




Thank you all so much for the birthday wishes today >_<!!





One of the best surprises ever!!!





I truly have the best friends  ;-; I love you all so much ❤️




WHEN DID YOU ALL PLAN THIS?? AHH WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE SUCH AMAZING PEOPLE 




Japan doesn’t have red velvet cake so I got red velvet cupcakes after talking about it on the stream. Thank you. I also ate strawberry short cake so today was fulfilling 😊




Idk why my eyes look so dead in the picture but technically I’m dead inside so my outer appearance is now catching up to my inner self I guess 

What did you guys do today? 




Guess what





9 minutes into my birthday and I was already giving mature love advice to my best friend 




A year older and therefore a year wiser 







Little information. My “best friend” right here still hasn’t told me Happy Birthday yet 








I was also supposed to go out today but I ended up napping it all off 




Here’s what happened.




I took a nap and woke up on a cliff hanger so I was like aight I gotta sleep again to continue 




Repeated that like 5 times and it was already night time. Oops... 




I can’t believe I slept off my birthday. Such a Sally move I’m not even surprised to be honest. 




Slept too much so I couldn’t go out and ended up making dinner instead lolol 




LOOK WHAT I MADEEEEE


I GOT SO MANY HEART WARMING BIRTHDAY WISHES TODAY WAS AMAZING ❤️❤️❤️❤️




CANT THANK YOU ENOUGH ❤️ 




I LOVE YOU ALL SO SO MUCH 




PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES 🍫🍫




HAVE A GOOD NIGHT MY LOVES!!
