Have a picture of me doing some last minute studying ✏️📝



The bracelet I have is a Haikyuu Nekoma High School merch. I’ve had it on for three years now. 



I’ve had these with me since 2015 wow.

I would just stick with having on one but I need all the luck I can get from the anime gods to pass my tests and just go through life in general. 




This is also my good luck pencil I have of Tsukishima Kei and a Oikawa keychain. I use it to take ALL my tests. 

Kinda yanked oikawa’s body on accident a couple years ago when I was nervous before a test so now he looks like that. RIP my hot prince. 

Anyway, I’m done with finals for the week!! I have more next week but the weekend is all mine! I’m gonna sleep til I melt my eye balls.
