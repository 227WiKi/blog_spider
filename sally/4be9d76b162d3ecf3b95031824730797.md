I CANT FREAKIN BELIEVE YOU GUYS




IM GONE FOR 4DAYS AND YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY MAKING MEMES OF OTHER MEMBERS???




EXCUSE ME??




B-E-T-R-A-Y-A-L




Obviously “loyal” doesn’t exist in your English dictionary so here you go:




Loyal:(adj) giving or showing firm and constant support 

Synonym: faithful 

Antonym: YOU ALL




Showing support to other members. Okay thank you for that. Much love ❤️ 




BUT MAKING MEMES??? 




WHAT?




MEMES???




WHAT IS THIS?????




I can’t believe this. 




Oh look. There goes all the faith I had



*SCREAMING*




You guys made my bunny pencil case poop chocolate 🍫 







The only reliable connection I have is this broken off piece of wall paper that looks like a finger. 






I can’t believe my coke gumi has a better bond with my elevator than we ever did. 


Okay all jokes aside. CANT WAIT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU ALL LATER TODAY!! 




IF YOU CANT MAKE IT TODAY? DONT WORRY ILL PROBABLY STREAM AGAIN THE NEXT DAY TOO SINCE IT SEEMS LIKE ALL YA’LL UNFAITHFUL BEINGS SEEM TO FORGET ABOUT ME AFTER NO STREAMS FOR 2 SECONDS👮🏻‍♀️👮🏻‍♀️👮🏻‍♀️👮🏻‍♀️👮🏻‍♀️(You know I love you) 




See you later 👋😘😘




P.S: 
I can still do twin tails with short hair 
And also everybody’s positive comments towards my new hair really made my day ❤️ Thank you guys so much I love everyone so much.
