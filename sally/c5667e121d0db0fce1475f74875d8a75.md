I’m bored in class so I came up with a new hobby: 

~making inspirational quotes with the rants I have for this world~

Exibit A



ALSO! 


TWO GIRLS SITTING NEXT TO ME ARE EXPOSING ME 


I look over to the two of them going through #天城サリー



Seat Partner: “wow everyone’s really cute. What’s your position in this group?” 

Me: “um.... I.....have a nice...... personality? ”

Seat Partner: “yea but nice doesn’t pay the bills” 

*gasp* 

WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS KIND OF TREATMENT 



💁🏻‍♀️😠🤤💁🏻‍♀️




This isn’t even my class-class..... I’m sitting here because I ate lunch in here and I lost the opportunity to get out. I don’t even have class on Wednesdays. I CAME TO SCHOOL TO WORK ON A GROUP PROJECT BUT WHERE IS MY GROUP 


Apparently this teacher doesn’t accept eating in class but he ain’t my teacher so~.....


Here have a picture of me taking a picture for my blog but accidentally pressing the multiple shutter thing and making a fool out of myself.




das me eating hot cheetohs with chopsticks 🥢 

Yes. 

Have a wonderful rest of your day.
